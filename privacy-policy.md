Privacy Policy
Last updated: February 15, 2026

This Privacy Policy describes we collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains that we do not collect or share your personal financial data.

1. Information Collection and Use
Personal Data
We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal financial data.
All data regarding your assets (cash amounts, gold holdings, currency types, etc.) is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this information, and it is never uploaded to any external server or cloud database owned by us.

Usage Data
We may collect minimal, anonymous usage data to improve the app's performance and stability. This may include:

Device type and operating system version.

Crash logs (via third-party services like Firebase Crashlytics or similar, if used).

General interaction data (e.g., which screens are visited most).

This data is not linked to your personal identity or your financial records.

2. Third-Party Services
The application uses third-party services to fetch real-time market data (e.g., exchange rates, gold prices).

Market Data Providers: When the app updates exchange rates, it sends a request to a public API. This request does not contain your personal financial data.

3. Data Security
Since your financial data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends largely on your device's security. We recommend that you keep your device secure and use a passcode or biometric authentication to prevent unauthorized access to your phone.

4. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
